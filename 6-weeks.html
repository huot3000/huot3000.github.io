              <h3>My Own Little Programming Retreat</h3>
              <p>I want to get dramatically better at programming. The idea is to get better at this by just ... doing it. 6 hours a day, for 6 weeks.</p>
              <p>The plan, at first, was to do RC. That didn't work out, hence the DIY approach. In those 6 weeks, my goals are to 
                  <li>get a solid understanding of how the web works (by building a scraper, an API, and a server)</li>
                  <li>be able to build data analysis tools from scratch (getting, manipulating, analyzing data.)</li> </p>
              <p>Will use Python. I might dabble with a bit of JS. Let's see! This is an experiment.</p>
              <p>I'll write about my progress each day <a href=https://www.notion.so/philippehuot/Six-Weeks-40aa7ed8f167486d9af16f7c5d8f3303>here</a>, starting June 29, 2020.</p>
