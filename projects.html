            <h3> Projects </h3>
            <p>Here are some things I have worked on, or am currently working on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Right now: </b>Collecting and distributing PPE (masks, shields, gloves) for Québec health workers facing COVID-19. Based in Québec and have any masks, faceshields, gloves or desinfectant? <a href=https://www.donnezlaprotection.com>Let us know!</a></li>
              <li>Launched a business matching homeowners with real estate agents. Great experience building a marketplace. Ran the company for ~1 year, ended up closing shop.</li>
              <li>Ran a seed-stage accelerator: <a href=https://www.FounderFuel.com>FounderFuel</a>. Tacos to term sheets. I need to write on this at some point.</li>
              <li>Wrote a bit on investing in Senegalese education. A rare opportunity to work on something public-facing. Consulting firms don't often share their slides to the world.</li>
              <li>Looked at whether decriminalizing cannabis consumption has an effect on crime, using pretty cool statistical methods (synthetic control groups!). Need to go back into heavier statistical work. So cool.</li>
            </ul>
