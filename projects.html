            <h3> Projects </h3>
            <p>Here are some things I have worked on, or am currently working on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Right now: </b> Learning Python. Writing daily about my progress <a href="https://www.philhuot.com/6-weeks">here</a>. Some of my code is on <a href=https://github.com/huot3000 >Github.</a></li>
              <li>Ran a PPE <a href=https://www.donnezlaprotection.com>donation marketplace</a> for Qu√©bec health workers facing COVID-19.</li>
              <li>Launched a business matching homeowners with real estate agents. Ended up closing shop.</li>
              <li>Ran a seed-stage accelerator: <a href=https://www.FounderFuel.com>FounderFuel</a>. Did a bit of everything, from tacos to term sheets. </li>
              <li>Did a dozen strategy projects working at Parthenon - Moroccan higher education, South African tourism, and Thai real estate - among other things. Also where I learned all those Excel shortcuts.</li>
              <li>Wrote about on investing in Senegalese education. You can check it out <a href=https://edafricareport.caeruscapital.co/thebusinessofeducationinafrica.pdf>here</a>!</li>
              <li>Looked at whether decriminalizing cannabis had an effect on crime, using pretty cool statistical methods (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_control_method#:~:text=The%20synthetic%20control%20method%20is,the%20treatment%20group%20is%20compared.>synthetic control groups!</a>).</li>
